# Rdio Scanner

[Rdio Scanner](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner) is a progressive web interface for listening to audio files generated by various recorders. Its interface tries to reproduce the user experience of a real police scanner, while adding its own touch.

The number of available recorders continues to grow. Among them, [Rdio Scanner](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner) has proven to be compatible and even very useful when used in conjunction with [Trunk Recorder](https://github.com/robotastic/trunk-recorder), [RTLSDR-Airband](https://github.com/szpajder/RTLSDR-Airband), [SDRTrunk](https://github.com/DSheirer/sdrtrunk), [csdr](https://github.com/ha7ilm/csdr) and many others.

The client web app is responsive and also works well on mobile devices.

## How it works

[Rdio Scanner](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner) has all the backend and frontend components to deal with your audio files.

The server side of [Rdio Scanner](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner) can monitor directories for audio files to be ingested, or has an API to upload audio files from a remote (or local) location. Those files are associated to defined systems/talkgroups from the configuration file, then stored locally in its database. The web application clients are notified of these new audio files based on their own systems/talkgroups selection. It is also possible for web application clients to browse for archived audio files and replay them in an offline manner, or download them individually.

## Main features

- It's a progressive web app that also works great on mobile devices.
- Simplistic interface, but strong usability.
- Configurable systems and talkgroups.
- Talkgroups from any systems can be grouped together for better selection of live streams.
- Access control via password with possible restriction to systems/talkgroups.
- Downloadable audio files from the database archives.
- Folder monitoring for new audio files to be ingested.
- Generic API to which you can push your audio files.
- Redistribute systems/talkgroups to other [Rdio Scanner](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner) instances.
- Automatic pruning of the database after a configurable number of days.
- Unit ID alias where you can display a label instead of its numeric value.
- Configurable LED colors based on system or talkgroup.
